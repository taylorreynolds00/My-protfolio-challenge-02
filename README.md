# My-protfolio-challenge-02
first i started by making the skeleton of my html commenting out the sections to the proper name

and then i started adding content to my page.

once i finished styleing my my initial page i started adding my media-querys 

once i started styleing my mediaquerys for max-width 415 i ran into a sticky element problem and could not figure it out
